**Bank Database**

This project was a fun way for me to experiment and learn new Java techniques.
It includes Enums, password encryption, class serialization and secure 'monetary' transactions.
The DynamicList class was a custom class I created which aimed to emulate and improve upon the default List class.

Developed in Nov 2023.
